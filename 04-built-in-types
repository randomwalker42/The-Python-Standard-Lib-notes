'''
standard types that are built into the interpreter

The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions.

4.2 Boolean operations: and, or, not 

priority: not > and > or 

4.3 Comparisons

All eight comparison operations in Python has the same priority, which is higher than that of the Boolean operations.

<	     (strictly less than)
<=	   (less than or equal)
>	     (strictly greater than)
>=	   (greater than or equal)
==	   (equal)
!=	   (not equal)
is	   (object identity)
is not (negated object identity)

4.4 Numeric types

There are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. 
In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. 

Several operations to be memorised:

x // y	: (floored quotient of x and y)

note: Also referred to as integer division. 
      The resultant value is a whole integer which is always rounded towards minus infinity.
      
math.trunc(x)	: (x truncated to Integral)
round(x[, n])	: (x rounded to n digits, rounding half to even. If n is omitted, it defaults to 0.)
math.floor(x)	: (the greatest Integral <= x)
math.ceil(x)	: (the least Integral >= x)

Additional methods on float:

float.as_integer_ratio()

此方法能够将小数转化为分数的形式，函数返回一个包含两个元素的元组，第一个元素代表分子，第二个元素代表分母。

float.is_integer()

Return True if the float instance is finite with integral value, and False otherwise

4.6 Sequence types: list, tuple, range 

Common sequence operations:

x in s	              : True if an item of s is equal to x, else False	
x not in s	          : False if an item of s is equal to x, else True	
s + t	                : the concatenation of s and t	
s * n or n * s	      : equivalent to adding s to itself n times	
s[i]	                : ith item of s, origin 0	
s[i:j]	              : slice of s from i to j
s[i:j:k]	            : slice of s from i to j with step k	
len(s)	              : length of s	 
min(s)	              : smallest item of s	 
max(s)        	      : largest item of s	 
s.index(x[, i[, j]])	: index of the first occurrence of x in s (at or after index i and before index j)	
s.count(x)	          : total number of occurrences of x in s	 

Mutable sequence operations:

s[i] = x	            : item i of s is replaced by x	 
s[i:j] = t	          : slice of s from i to j is replaced by the contents of the iterable t	 
del s[i:j]	          : same as s[i:j] = []	 
s[i:j:k] = t	        : the elements of s[i:j:k] are replaced by those of t	
del s[i:j:k]	        : removes the elements of s[i:j:k] from the list	 
s.append(x)	          : appends x to the end of the sequence (same as s[len(s):len(s)] = [x])	 
s.clear()	            : removes all items from s (same as del s[:])	
s.copy()	            : creates a shallow copy of s (same as s[:])	
s.extend(t) or s += t	: extends s with the contents of t (for the most part the same as s[len(s):len(s)] = t)	 
s *= n	              : updates s with its contents repeated n times	
s.insert(i, x)	      : inserts x into s at the index given by i (same as s[i:i] = [x])	 
s.pop([i])	          : retrieves the item at i and also removes it from s	
s.remove(x)	          : remove the first item from s where s[i] == x	
s.reverse()	          : reverses the items of s in place	

Lists:

Lists may be constructed in several ways:

Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: []
Using square brackets, separating items with commas: [a], [a, b, c]
Using a list comprehension: [x for x in iterable]
Using the type constructor: list() or list(iterable)

Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations and have an additional method sort().

sort(*, key=None, reverse=None)
This method sorts the list in place, using only < comparisons between items. 

key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower). 
The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. 
The default value of None means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value.

与内置函数sorted()的区别在于，使用sort()方法会直接改变原始序列，而sorted()只会返回一个改变过后的新序列，原序列不会发生变化。

Tuples:

Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data,
and are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed.

Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:

Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: ()
Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: a, or (a,)
Separating items with commas: a, b, c or (a, b, c)
Using the tuple() built-in: tuple() or tuple(iterable)

Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses.

Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations.

Ranges:

The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers, 
and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.

class range(start, stop[, step])

The arguments to the range constructor must be integers. 
If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to 1. 
If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to 0. 
If step is zero, ValueError is raised.

The contents of a range r are determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop.
(也就是说stop的值无法取到，但是start的值可以。）

Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except concatenation and repetition.

The advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple: 
A range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents

4.7 String methods

Strings implement all of the common sequence operations.

In addition, strings also support some other methods:

str.capitalize() 返回一个新的字符串，其首字母大写，后面的内容全部小写

str.count(sub[, start[, end]]) 返回字符串中某一个/段字符出现的次数

str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]]) 用于检测字符串末尾的值，返回一个Boolean

str.find(sub[, start[, end]]) 用于查找字符串中某一片段的位置(第一次出现的位置），返回索引，若无结果返回-1
(与str.index()用法相同）

str.format() 可以用来改变字符串中某个片段，返回修改过后的新字符串，原字符串不变。

"The sum of 1 + 2 is {0}".format(1+2)

花括号中的为需要被替换的部分，函数的参数则为替换的部分。

str.isalnum()

Return true if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and there is at least one character, false otherwise. 

str.isalpha()

Return true if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, false otherwise. 

str.isdecimal()

Return true if all characters in the string are decimal characters and there is at least one character, false otherwise. 

str.isdigit()

Return true if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, false otherwise.

str.isnumeric()

Return true if all characters in the string are numeric characters, and there is at least one character, false otherwise.

str.isspace()

Return true if there are only whitespace characters in the string and there is at least one character, false otherwise. 

str.isupper() 用来判读字符串中的字母是否都为大写，返回一个Boolean
str.islower() 同理

str.join(iterable)

Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable.

str.lower()

Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters converted to lowercase.

str.lstrip([chars]) 将chars中包含的字符从字符串的左边移除，返回一个新的字符串。

If omitted or None, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace.

>>> '   spacious   '.lstrip()
'spacious   '
>>> 'www.example.com'.lstrip('cmowz.')
'example.com'

具体的工作原理好像是从左开始遇到第一个不在chars中的字符串就自动停止了

str.strip([chars])

Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.

使用strip的话则会将所有符合的字符移除，从头至尾（待定）

str.partition(sep)

Split the string at the first occurrence of sep, 
and return a 3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator.

str.rpartition(sep)

Split the string at the last occurrence of sep.

str.replace(old, new[, count])

Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. 
If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.

str.swapcase()

Return a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase and vice versa.

str.title()

Return a titlecased version of the string where words start with an uppercase character 
and the remaining characters are lowercase.

str.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])
Return the highest index in the string where substring sub is found, 
such that sub is contained within s[start:end]. 

Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. 
Return -1 on failure.

str.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])
Like rfind() but raises ValueError when the substring sub is not found.

str.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)

Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string. 
If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done, the rightmost ones. 
If sep is not specified or None, any whitespace string is a separator.

str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)

Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string. 
If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done (thus, the list will have at most maxsplit+1 elements). 
If maxsplit is not specified or -1, then there is no limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made).

str.splitlines([keepends])

Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries. 
Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends is given and true.

用来处理文本文档很有用。

str.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])

Return True if string starts with the prefix, otherwise return False. 
prefix can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for. 

4.9 Set types: set and frozenset 

A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. 

Common uses:

membership testing, 
removing duplicates from a sequence,
computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference

Being an unordered collection, sets do not record element position or order of insertion. 
Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior.

The difference between set and frozenset:

set: mutable, has no hash value and cannot be used as either a dictionary key or as an element of another set
frozenset: immutable and hashable 

Non-empty sets (not frozensets) can be created by placing a comma-separated list of elements within braces

for example: {'jack', 'sjoerd'}

common operations:

isdisjoint(other)

Return True if the set has no elements in common with other. 
Sets are disjoint if and only if their intersection is the empty set

set <= other
Test whether every element in the set is in other.

set < other
Test whether the set is a proper subset of other, that is, set <= other and set != other.

set >= other
Test whether every element in other is in the set.

set > other
Test whether the set is a proper superset of other, that is, set >= other and set != other.

set | other | ...
Return a new set with elements from the set and all others.

set & other & ...
Return a new set with elements common to the set and all others.

set - other - ...
Return a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.

set ^ other
Return a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.

copy()
Return a new set with a shallow copy of s.

Set elements, like dictionary keys, must be hashable.

Operations for sets only (not for frozensets):

set |= other | ...
Update the set, adding elements from all others.

set &= other & ...
Update the set, keeping only elements found in it and all others.

set -= other | ...
Update the set, removing elements found in others.

set ^= other
Update the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but not in both.

add(elem)
Add element elem to the set.

remove(elem)
Remove element elem from the set. Raises KeyError if elem is not contained in the set.

discard(elem)
Remove element elem from the set if it is present.

pop()
Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Raises KeyError if the set is empty.

clear()
Remove all elements from the set.
 
Mapping types: dict

A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. 
Mappings are mutable objects. 
There is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary. 

A dictionary’s keys are almost arbitrary values. 

Dictionaries can be created by placing a comma-separated list of key: value pairs within braces, 
for example: {'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127} or {4098: 'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}, or by the dict constructor.

Demostration of different ways to construct a dict:

>>> a = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
>>> b = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
>>> c = dict(zip(['one', 'two', 'three'], [1, 2, 3]))
>>> d = dict([('two', 2), ('one', 1), ('three', 3)])
>>> e = dict({'three': 3, 'one': 1, 'two': 2})
>>> a == b == c == d == e
True

Common operations:

d[key]
Return the item of d with key key. Raises a KeyError if key is not in the map.

d[key] = value
Set d[key] to value.

del d[key]
Remove d[key] from d. Raises a KeyError if key is not in the map.

key in d
Return True if d has a key key, else False.

key not in d
Equivalent to not key in d.

clear()
Remove all items from the dictionary.

copy()
Return a shallow copy of the dictionary.

classmethod fromkeys(seq[, value])
Create a new dictionary with keys from seq and values set to value.

fromkeys() is a class method that returns a new dictionary. value defaults to None.

get(key[, default])
Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.

items()
Return a new view of the dictionary’s items ((key, value) pairs).

keys()
Return a new view of the dictionary’s keys.

pop(key[, default])
If key is in the dictionary, remove it and return its value, else return default. 

popitem()
Remove and return an arbitrary (key, value) pair from the dictionary.

setdefault(key[, default])
If key is in the dictionary, return its value. If not, insert key with a value of default and return default. default defaults to None.

update([other])
Update the dictionary with the key/value pairs from other, overwriting existing keys. Return None.

values()
Return a new view of the dictionary’s values.

Dictionaries compare equal if and only if they have the same (key, value) pairs. 
Order comparisons (‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>=’, ‘>’) raise TypeError.
